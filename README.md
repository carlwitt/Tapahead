# Tapahead - Visualizing Tempo Variations

Tap data is generated by a user sending a regular time pulse to indicate a tempo. Raw tap data is not very helpful to visualize tempo variations, because of high short-term fluctuation.

One challenge is that tap accuracy is usually poor on peripheral devices. Another is that playing like a metronome is just difficult : )
For instance, the notable tempo difference between 110 bpm and 120 bpm maps to a tap interval difference of only 50 milliseconds (0.55 seconds vs 0.5 seconds). For comparsion: a user trying to react as quickly as possible to a random stimulus needs in the order of hundreds of milliseconds.

To visualize tempo variations in tap data, a combination of a running average and a Savitzky-Golay filter seems appropriate.

In the long term, I'd like to have an app or web-based tool that helps practicing absolute timing (tapping the right BPM).
An interesting use case would be to interactively give some feedback on how tempo changes over time. I think this isn't easy, because a user trying to implement corrective feedback behaves differently than a user polling her/his internal clock. On the other hand, feedback on past tempo variations (like the image above) seems relatively useless for practicing, other than double checking one's self-assessment or deciding whether one is close enough to practice goals.
